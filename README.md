# App-Debugger
A simple script for reading Android and iOS device logs on Mac OS.

This script uses adb logcat and idevicesyslog to read iOS and Android device logs in real time. At its simplest, the script runs adb logcat or idevicesyslog and filters the logs based on user input. However, users are encouraged to add custom logic to make the script more useful to their particular needs. See the comments in the file for strategies on how to do this.
